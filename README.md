# MyJavaCollection

This repository contains my implementation of a custom Java collection inspired by the Java Collection Framework. 
It includes various data structures and algorithms commonly used in collections, allowing you to store and manipulate elements in a flexible and efficient manner.

## Features

- Custom implementations of interfaces like List, Queue, Deque.
- Common collection operations such as adding, removing, and searching elements.
- Iteration and traversal support with iterators and enhanced for loops.
- Support for generic types to allow the collection to store objects of different classes.
- Exception handling and error checking for edge cases and invalid operations.
- Unit tests for each collection class to ensure correctness and robustness.
- Comprehensive documentation and code comments for easy understanding and usage.

## Usage

To use this custom collection in your Java project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Include the necessary collection classes in your project by importing the corresponding packages.
3. Use the collection classes as you would with any standard Java collection. Refer to the documentation and code comments for more information on each collection's usage and available methods.
